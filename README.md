Styleguide
==========

This guide has two humble goals: 

- Help newbies quickly figure out preferred project style
- Saves time for older peers about talking their brilliant preferred style ;-)


The very first rule
-------------------

The very first rule of all rules: Follow project style guide ;-)

1) Honor css classic style for class names, preferred example:

    %h1.js-foldable

Not prefered: %h1.js_foldable nor %h1.jsFoldable

2) Add js- prefix for classes/id when you use those with javascript, example:
 
    %h1.js-foldable

When following js- prefix style, it's later way easier to figure
out what classes/id's are pure style related and what are javascript related.
